### Explanation:
1. **Section Header**: The `<h2>` tag provides a title for the donation section.
2. **Description**: A brief paragraph explaining the purpose of the donation.
3. **Form**: The `<form>` element contains input fields for the donor's name, email, donation amount, and payment method.
   - **Input Fields**: Each input field is labeled for clarity, and the `required` attribute ensures that users fill them out before submission.
   - **Payment Method**: A dropdown menu allows users to select their preferred payment method.
4. **Submit Button**: A button to submit the form.

### Note:
- The `action` attribute in the form should point to the server-side script that will handle the donation processing.
- You may want to add additional features such as validation, styling with CSS, and integration with a payment gateway (like Stripe or PayPal) for actual payment processing.
